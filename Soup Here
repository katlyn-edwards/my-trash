When coupled with the average sleep duration of 6.5 hours, this could indicate that students are balancing their study schedules with their sleep, although it might not be the most optimal for peak academic performance, as inadequate sleep can affect cognitive functions and concentration.\n\n3. **Screen Time Impact**:\n   - The maximum screen time of 4 hours could be a contributing factor to the relatively lower sleep duration. High screen time, especially before bedtime, is known to disrupt sleep quality due to exposure to blue light, which can interfere with the body's natural sleep-wake cycle.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe combination of moderate study hours (6 hours), shorter sleep duration (6.5 hours), and significant screen time (up to 4 hours) suggests that students may be experiencing a lifestyle imbalance. Improving sleep quality and reducing screen time before bed could potentially enhance academic performance by allowing students to achieve more restorative sleep. Encouraging better sleep hygiene practices could be a beneficial strategy for optimizing study effectiveness and overall well-being.\n\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"32\"></a>\n### <div style=\"text-align:left; border-radius:15px; padding:20px; color:Black; margin:0; font-size:100%; font-family:Arial; background-color:#48cae4; overflow:hidden\"><b>‚ö° 2.

However, for both genders, sleep duration tends to fluctuate throughout their university years, with some improvement during the middle years (2nd and 3rd) and a slight decline in the final year, possibly due to increased academic demands.

This suggests that male students, on average, dedicate a significant amount of time to studying daily. Given their median sleep duration of 6.2 hours, the balance between study and sleep appears to be relatively even, though they might still fall short of the recommended sleep duration for optimal cognitive function.\n\n- **Female Students**:\n  - The median study hours for females is 5.3 hours. This indicates that female students, on average, spend slightly less time studying compared to their male counterparts. With a median sleep duration of 6.75 hours, it suggests that female students may prioritize sleep more than study time, potentially leading to better sleep quality and overall well-being.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe data shows that male students tend to spend more time studying than female students, which might be contributing to their shorter sleep duration. Female students, on the other hand, seem to have a better balance between sleep and study, with slightly less time dedicated to studying and more to sleep. This could potentially lead to better academic performance and mental health, as adequate sleep is known to improve cognitive functioning, memory retention, and stress management.\n\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"35\"></a>\n### <div style=\"text-align:left; border-radius:15px; padding:20px; color:Black; margin:0; font-size:100%; font-family:Arial; background-color:#48cae4; overflow:hidden\"><b>‚ö° 5.

This could reflect a more balanced lifestyle, with students possibly learning to manage their time and stress better.\n   - **Female Students:** Caffeine intake remains stable at 2 units, showing that female students maintain a lower level of caffeine consumption consistently across years.\n\n4. **4th Year:**\n   - **Male Students:** Caffeine intake remains at 2 units, consistent with the 3rd year, despite potential increases in academic pressure related to final projects or graduation preparation. This suggests that male students may have developed strategies to manage caffeine intake.\n   - **Female Students:** Caffeine intake stays at 2 units, indicating that female students continue to consume less caffeine compared to males, even in their final year.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Male Students:** Show a clear decline in caffeine consumption as they progress through the university, with the highest intake in the first year and a steady decrease thereafter. This trend may reflect their adaptation to university life and the establishment of more sustainable sleep patterns over time.\n- **Female Students:** Exhibit consistent caffeine consumption across all years, with a lower average intake than males.

This aligns with typical behavior where people tend to stay up later during the weekends.\n- **Longer Sleep Duration on Weekends:** Although the sleep duration is not dramatically different (8.2 hours on weekdays vs. 8.4 hours on weekends), the later wake-up time on weekends allows for more restorative sleep.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe data indicates that students' sleep schedules vary between weekdays and weekends, with later bedtimes and slightly extended sleep durations on weekends. This pattern may reflect lifestyle changes, social activities, or the need to recover from potential sleep deficits accumulated during the week. Encouraging consistent sleep schedules could help improve overall sleep quality and daily functioning.\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"conclusion\"></a>\n<div style=\"background-color: #48cae4; border-radius: 15px; padding: 20px; text-align: left;\">\n    <h1 style=\"margin: 0;\">\n        <b>\n            <span style=\"color: Black;\">Last but not least, the final chapter</span>\n            <br><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">|</span>\n            <span style=\"color: #FEEC37;\"> Draw an Conclusion üìù\n            </span>\n        </b>\n    </h1>\n<br>\n    <a href=\"#table-of-contents\" style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; background-color: #7b2cbf; color: #ffffff; padding: 7px 15px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 15px;\">\n        [Table of Content üìú‚¨ÜÔ∏è]\n    </a>\n</div>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div  style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; background-color: #7b2cbf; color: #ffffff; padding: 7px 15px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 15px;\">\n\n# Conclusion :  \n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n1. **Sleep Duration Analysis:**\n   - The median sleep duration is 6.5 hours, indicating that many students may not be meeting the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep for optimal health.\n   - Male students have a median sleep duration of 6.2 hours, while female students sleep slightly more, with a median of 6.75 hours.\n\n2. **Study Hours:**\n   - The median study time is 6 hours, suggesting a moderate study routine for students.\n   - Male students tend to study more (6.15 hours) compared to females (5.3 hours), which may affect their sleep duration.\n\n3. **Screen Time Influence:**\n   - The maximum screen time recorded is 4 hours, which could be impacting sleep quality, as high screen time before bed can disrupt the natural sleep-wake cycle.\n\n4. **Caffeine Intake Trends:**\n   - Caffeine consumption is higher in the first year, especially for male students (3 units), and gradually decreases over the years.\n   - Female students have a consistent caffeine intake of around 2 units across all university years, showing lower dependence on caffeine than males.\n\n5. **Sleep Timing Patterns:**\n   - On weekdays, students typically sleep from 10:36 PM to 6:48 AM, averaging 8.2 hours of sleep.\n   - On weekends, sleep starts later (12:36 AM) and ends around 9:00 AM, extending sleep duration to about 8.4 hours.\n\n6. **Gender Differences in Sleep Patterns:**\n   - Female students generally maintain more consistent sleep patterns and consume less caffeine compared to male students.\n   - Male students show fluctuations in sleep duration and caffeine intake, particularly in the first year.\n\n7. **Impact of University Year on Sleep:**\n   - Sleep duration improves slightly in the middle university years but tends to decrease again in the final year, possibly due to increased academic pressure.\n\n# Recommendations:\n- Encourage better sleep hygiene and consistent sleep schedules to improve overall sleep quality.\n- Limit screen time before bed and manage caffeine intake to help maintain healthier sleep patterns.\n- Provide time management strategies to balance study hours with adequate sleep for optimal academic performance.\n\n</div>","metadata":{}}]}
